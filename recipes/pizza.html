    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>A margherita pizza is a classic Italian pizza known for its simple yet high-quality 
        ingredients that represent the colors of the Italian flag. Originating in Naples, 
        it features a thin, hand-kneaded crust, often baked in a wood-fired oven.
        The toppings consist of vibrant red San Marzano tomato sauce, 
        fresh white mozzarella cheese, and aromatic green basil leaves.
        A final drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil brings all the fresh, 
        tangy, and creamy flavors together in a harmonious and authentic Italian delight.</p>
